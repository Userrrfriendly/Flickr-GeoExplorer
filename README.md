## Flicker Geoexplorer (Work in progress)

Explore the world through photographs.

### Geoexplorer lets you query [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/)'s **_public_** photos geographically.

To search for photos that were taken in a particular location simply center the blue circle on the map (either by dragging it by navigating to the desired location on the map and hit the button that centers the circle on the current map extents) and hit the search button. The app will fetch all photos that were taken within the blue circle. 
(You can change the diameter of the search circle)
Photographs can be pinned to the map to see the exact location they were taken.
