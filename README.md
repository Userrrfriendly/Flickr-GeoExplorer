## World Gallery

Explore the world through Flickr's photos with one click

### World Gallery is a Web App that lets you query [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) public photos by the location that they were taken.

To search for photos that were taken in a particular location simply center the the map on the desired location (you can use the geolocation searchbar that is powered by Google's location autocomplete to easily center the desired country, city, landmark, establishment or address on the map) and hit the search button. The app will fetch all photos that were taken within the map extents.

Photos that match the criteria will be pinned at the map to the exact location they were taken\*.

\*On average a photo taken with a camera with a GPS or a smartphone will have an error of 5-15 meters. No spatial accuracy can be guaranteed for photos where geolocation was set explicitly.
