## Flicker Geoexplorer (Work in progress)

Explore the world through photographs.

### Geoexplorer lets you query flickr's public photos geographically.

To search for photos that were taken in a particular location simply choose a location on the map and add a marker (radius marker) on the map. The app will fetch all photos that were taken within 5km of the marker. Alternatively instead of searching by radius around the placed marker you can use the bounding box that lets you draw a draggable/resizable polygon for more customizable search.
